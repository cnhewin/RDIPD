## About HAPD

This is a story  on r&d consulting.

About ten years ago, I entered the r&d management consultation and worked as a junior consultant. After 20 organizations' experience, I confused by the old model that it seemed not to adapt some new business. I decide to improve the model according to my think.

I have used the new model in 3 enterprises and got good feedback, so I named it HAPD. HAPD is a hybrid method of IPD in hardware and agile in software.

I will use HAPD in more teams and optimize itï¼Œand hope that it can give helps to more business bodies.
